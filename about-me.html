				<h2>
					Science
				</h2>
				<p>
					I started out in the University of Gothenburg studying
					biology and molecular biology. I took my Bachelor's degree
					there and went on to also take my Masters. For both my
					Bachelor's and Master's thesis I worked with Jonas Warringer.
					I was doing large scale experimental evolution in yeast and
					contributing to setting up a methodology for high through-put
					colony phenotyping <a href = "http://www.g3journal.org/content/6/9/3003.full?sid=fcf4a0af-667b-43bd-aa93-6fcd562e9791">
					(<u>scan-o-matic</u>)</a>.
					<br>
					<br>
					From there I went to Gianni Liti's lab in Nice for a 6 month
					Erasmus internship. While I was there I applied for the
					<a href = "http://signalife.unice.fr/"><u>LabEx Signalife PhD program</u></a>
					at the University of Nice, Sophia Antipolis. I was enrolled and
					began my PhD in Gianni's lab at the <a href = 'http://ircan.org/'><u>Institute for Research on Cancer
					and Aging, Nice</u></a> in 2014.
					<br>
					<br>
					I have a rather broad interest in science and its progression, but 
					mainly I am interested in phenotypic variation and what genetic mechanisms
					underlie it.
					<br>
					The first part of my PhD focused on variance decomposition and 
					phenotype predicitions in diploid strains of <i>Saccharomyces
					cerevisiae</i>. This resulted in two nice papers published in Nature
					Communications. Check them out over at <a href = "papers.html"><u>papers</u></a>.

					I try to divide my spare time among my different hobbies, which you can find
					below, roughly listed in decreasing order of time spent per year:
					<br>
					<ol>
					<li>Working out</li>
					<li>Cooking (perhaps not so much a hobby as it is a keen attitude to staying alive)</li>
					<li>Book writing</li>
					<li>Learning Spanish</li>
					<li>Web design</li>
					<li>Awfully low tech animation</li>
					<li>Hiking</li>
					<li>Nature photography</li>
					</ol>

					This website

				<p>
					I built this website myself using html and css.

					<br>
					Thumbnails and logos I made using Inkscape with a couple of exceptions:
					<ul>
						<li>The scan-o-matic logo, designed by scan-o-matic</li>
						<li>The <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/"><u>ResearchGate</u></a>
